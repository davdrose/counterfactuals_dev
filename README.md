Counterfactual reasoning---reasoning about what did not happen, but might have---is a fundamental cognitive capacity. The development of counterfactual reasoning is linked to, among other things, understanding causation, pretense, rules, and mental states. Estimates of when
children’s capacity for counterfactual thinking develops range from as early as 2 to as late as 12 and virtually everywhere
between. We suggest that this is, in part, due to relying on counterfactual language to proper counterfactual thinking. We develop a paradigm for probing counterfactual thinking that doesn't rely on counterfactual language, and that can distinguish hypothetical from counterfactual reasoning. Using this paradigm, we find, in Experiment~1, that three-year old children can engage in hypothetical reasoning. Building on our paradigm, we find in Experiment~2, that by around 6, children show signs of engaging in counterfactual reasoning. Nothing that this might be explained by children instead engaging in hypothetical reasoning, we extend our paradigm in Experiment~3, to develop a more stringent test. We find that around 6, children engage in counterfactual reasoning. Our findings suggest that the capacity to engage in counterfactual reasoning may build on the capacity to engage in hypothetical reasoning.
