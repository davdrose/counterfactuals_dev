## Experiment 1

 - adults ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/yqvfz)) 
 - children ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/sdbx7)) 

In this experiment, adults and children who were between the ages of 3 - 6, were given situations where Granny drops two differnet objects and both are caught. One of these objects not being caught would have led to a worse outcome. 

The adult version was implemented in [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/). The experiment can be previewed by clicking the relevant links in the README.md [here](https://github.com/davdrose/counterfactuals_dev). If you download the files from this experiment folder, you can run the experiment locally by running index.html in your browser.

The version for children was implemented in [Lookit](https://childrenhelpingscience.com/). To view the experiments in [Lookit](https://childrenhelpingscience.com/), first create a dummy experiment, then click on "Edit Study Design" in the right-hand column. Next, go to "Protocol Configuration" and paste the JSON file for the experiment that you want to view. Click "Save Changes" at the bottom. Once redirected to the study's main page, click "Preview Study."  *** Note: You must have a Lookit researcher account to do this. You can register for a researcher account [here](https://childrenhelpingscience.com/registration/).


## Experiment 2

 - adults ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/ytjsp)) 
 - children ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/r52dt))

In this experiment, adults and children who were between the ages of 3 - 6, were given situations where Granny drops two of the same objects and both are caught. One of these objects not being caught would have led to a worse outcome. 

The adult version was implemented in [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/). The experiment can be previewed by clicking the relevant links in the README.md [here](https://github.com/davdrose/counterfactuals_dev). If you download the files from this experiment folder, you can run the experiment locally by running index.html in your browser.

## Experiment 3

 - adults ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/mwb9e)) 
 - children ([pre-registration](https://osf.io/e8pqt))

This experiment had the same design as experiment 2. The difference is that participants only saw which outcome would have been worse after the objects were caught.

The adult version was implemented in [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/).
