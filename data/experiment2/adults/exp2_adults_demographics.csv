276,exp4,57,Non-Hispanic,obviously the one that prevented an item from being broken or destroyed,Female,White,
289,exp4,37,Non-Hispanic,the person that prevented the mot damage. although the argument could be made for either as both had good intentions.,Male,White,
281,exp4,68,Non-Hispanic,where the harm could be more yet his friends save it.,Male,White,
284,exp4,52,Non-Hispanic,I chose the one that would fall and cause another issue when it landed. Like breaking an item or spilling a drink.,Female,White,
280,exp4,65,Non-Hispanic,Tried to thank the person who caught the item that would be harmed the most by falling,Female,White,
298,exp4,21,Non-Hispanic,"I decided that Granny should give the thank you stickers to the person who minimized the most amount of potential damage. So if more damage would have been done if that person did not catch the object, I decided Granny should thank that person.",Female,Black/African American,
302,exp4,26,Non-Hispanic,Which thing would be worse to break,Female,White,
308,exp4,48,Non-Hispanic,I chose based on which person proved more helpful due to their location.,Female,Black/African American,
288,exp4,23,Non-Hispanic,Whether the object was hard or soft. Would the object be broke or tarnish if dropped.,Female,Black/African American,
294,exp4,24,Non-Hispanic,"I was imagining the scenarios as if I was granny. Mainly if catching the object would change the outcome sufficiently. For instance that one scenario with the apple and trashcan. I awarded the one that caught it while not above the trash can since, in real life, if an apple was already THAT close to the trash I will have just asked them to toss it anyway. ",Female,Asian,
296,exp4,27,Non-Hispanic,the factors i considered were what item was being dropped and what was under the item being dropped.,Male,White,
306,exp4,29,,Whoever theoretically prevented more damage got the note,Male,White,
279,exp4,48,Non-Hispanic,"I wanted to ""save"" the object that was going to be affected by what was falling.",Female,Multiracial,
285,exp4,51,,,,,
300,exp4,33,Non-Hispanic,I chose the person that prevented a bigger damage from occurring to receive the thank you sticker.,Male,White,
290,exp4,35,Non-Hispanic,I decided based on the end result of dropping the item. ,Female,White,
286,exp4,57,Non-Hispanic,"if an object would break, I would pick that person catching to prevent from breaking. good survey",Female,White,
307,exp4,30,Non-Hispanic,,Female,Black/African American,
303,exp4,30,Hispanic,"I thanked whoever was saving the object from doing damage. The teddy bear was soft and would land on the floor, but it would ruin both the bear and the food if it had been dropped in the bowl of food. A basket ball can bounce on the floor and be fine, but if it landed on all the eggs, it would ruin the eggs, plus cause a big mess on the floors, the basketball. Those were the kinds of thoughts I had. ",Female,White,
297,exp4,32,Non-Hispanic,"There was a chance something bad would happen, sometimes both choices were similar.",Male,White,
292,exp4,39,Hispanic,The most important factor is what would be the worst result if the item wasn't caught,Male,White,
295,exp4,33,Non-Hispanic,Thanks,Female,Black/African American,
299,exp4,59,Non-Hispanic,The hand that protects the items,Female,Black/African American,
283,exp4,51,,Which item would do more damage,Female,White,
293,exp4,24,Hispanic,Whether or not the impact would be worse or not.,Male,Black/African American,
305,exp4,31,Non-Hispanic,If the object had a safe cushion underneath it I chose the opposite hand so the object wouldnt shatter,Male,White,
277,exp4,29,Non-Hispanic,"In the second to last scenario, I meant to choose Lily (saved the apple from falling into the trash) to receive the thank you sticker, not Alex. I chose to give the sticker to who ever saved Granny from the most inconvenience. ",Female,White,
301,exp4,35,Hispanic,,Male,Multiracial,
287,exp4,25,Non-Hispanic,Whether something wuld get ruined if something fell on it.,Female,White,
282,exp4,31,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,
291,exp4,63,Non-Hispanic,"There were no issues during the study, and I was able to complete it smoothly, achieving the desired results.",Male,White,
